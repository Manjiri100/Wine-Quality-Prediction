🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

Predicting wine quality based on physicochemical properties using Machine Learning! 🧠✨

This project leverages Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify wine as either "good" or "bad" based on various features like acidity, sugar content, and more.

🔍 Project Description

This project aims to build a classification model to predict the quality of wine. The dataset contains several features such as:

Fixed acidity 🧪

Residual sugar 🍬

Citric acid 🍋

pH levels ⚗️

Alcohol content 🍶

We categorize wine quality into two labels:

Bad wine 🍂

Good wine 🌟

The project explores data preprocessing, visualizations, and the implementation of machine learning models to predict wine quality effectively.

📊 Data Visualization

We use Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize the relationship between features and wine quality.
